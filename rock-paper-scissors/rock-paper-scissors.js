// Computer's choice
// Generate random number first
// Based on the random number, assign either of the three choices: rock, paper or scissors
// Store that choice in a variable as computer's choice

// Human's choice
// Ask for human's choice: rock, paper or scissors
// Assign that value to a variable as human's choice

// Setup score trackers
// Create a computer score variable and initialize it with 0
// Create a human score variable and initialize it with 0

// Game playing
// Create a function that takes two arguments: computer's choice and human's choice
// This function compares both and addresses the user by saying something like: "You lose! Paper beats Rock!"

// Score increment
// If the computer choice beat human choice, increment the computer score by 1
// If the human choice beat computer choice, increment the human score by 1
