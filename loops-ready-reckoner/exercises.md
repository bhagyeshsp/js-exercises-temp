**Here's a revised JavaScript Loop Ready Reckoner with 3-5 practical exercises for each loop type:**

**For Loop**

1. **Array Iteration:**
   Given an array of products, calculate the total cost of all products.
2. **String Manipulation:**
   Reverse a given string using a for loop.
3. **Number Pattern:**
   Print the following number pattern:
   ```
   1
   1 2
   1 2 3
   1 2 3 4
   ```
4. **Prime Number Check:**
   Check if a given number is prime using a for loop.
5. **Fibonacci Series:**
   Generate the first 10 Fibonacci numbers using a for loop.

**While Loop**

1. **User Input:**
   Prompt the user to enter a number. Keep prompting until the user enters a positive number.
2. **Guessing Game:**
   Create a number guessing game where the user has 5 attempts to guess a randomly generated number.
3. **Menu-Driven Program:**
   Implement a simple menu-driven program with options like "Add", "Subtract", "Multiply", and "Divide". Use a while loop to keep the menu running until the user chooses to exit.
4. **Factorial Calculation:**
   Calculate the factorial of a given number using a while loop.
5. **Countdown Timer:**
   Create a countdown timer that counts down from 10 to 0, displaying each number on the console.

**Do-While Loop**

1. **Menu-Driven Program:**
   Similar to the while loop example, but ensure the menu is displayed at least once, even if the user enters an invalid choice.
2. **Input Validation:**
   Keep prompting the user to enter a valid email address until a valid format is provided.
3. **Dice Roll Simulation:**
   Simulate rolling a dice until a specific number (e.g., 6) is rolled.
4. **Random Number Generation:**
   Generate random numbers between 1 and 100 until a number greater than 90 is generated.
5. **Game Loop:**
   Create a simple game loop that continuously updates the game state and renders the game to the screen.

**Remember to provide clear instructions and expected outputs for each exercise.**
